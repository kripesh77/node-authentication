# Node Authentication Project

This is my Node.js authentication app with JWT.
This is my learning project.
Also, if you want to check out the live demo of the app, feel free to...
I haven't used database for this project. I stored user information in local variable.

## Live Demo

Check out the live demo of the app: [https://node-authentication-dhzx.onrender.com/](https://node-authentication-dhzx.onrender.com/)

## How to run locally

1. Clone the repo on your computer
2. Run "npm install"
3. Replace the link (https://node-authentication-dhzx.onrender.com/) from the app with "http://localhost:2000"
   NOTE: Donot replace routes. (If the link says: "https://node-authentication-dhzx.onrender.com/signup", replace with "http://localhost:2000/signup" and so on)
4. Start your server with `node index.js`
5. Enjoy!!✌️
